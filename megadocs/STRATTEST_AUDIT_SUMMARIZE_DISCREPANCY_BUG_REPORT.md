## Architectural Issues Identified

### 1. Dual-System Architecture Problem

The system maintains two separate calculation engines:
- `sentio_cli strattest`: Virtual market simulation engine
- `sentio_audit`: Audit trail analysis engine

**Problems:**
- No synchronization between systems
- Different calculation methodologies
- Different data interpretations
- No validation mechanism

### 2. Data Source Inconsistency

**STRATTEST:**
- Uses virtual market simulation
- Generates synthetic market data
- Uses future QQQ tracks for AI regime testing

**AUDIT:**
- Uses actual historical data
- Records real fill events
- Uses different time periods

### 3. Metric Calculation Divergence

**Sharpe Ratio:**
- Different volatility calculations
- Different risk-free rate assumptions
- Different return series definitions

**Return Calculations:**
- Different compounding methods
- Different time period definitions
- Different baseline calculations

**Drawdown Calculations:**
- Different peak identification algorithms
- Different trough detection methods
- Different time window definitions

### 4. Time Period Confusion

**Multiple Conflicting Reports:**
- "30 days" simulation period
- "31 trading days" 
- "28 trading days" test period
- Different start/end timestamps

## Impact Assessment

### 1. Trust and Reliability Issues

- **High Impact**: Users cannot trust either system's results
- **Medium Impact**: Decision-making based on unreliable metrics
- **High Impact**: Potential financial losses from incorrect strategy evaluation

### 2. System Integration Problems

- **High Impact**: Dual-system architecture creates maintenance burden
- **Medium Impact**: No single source of truth for performance metrics
- **High Impact**: Difficult to debug and validate results

### 3. User Experience Degradation

- **Medium Impact**: Confusing and contradictory reports
- **High Impact**: Loss of confidence in system accuracy
- **Medium Impact**: Increased support burden

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Historical Architecture Debt

The system evolved from separate components:
- Original audit system for recording trades
- New virtual market system for strategy testing
- No integration or synchronization between systems

### 2. Different Calculation Philosophies

**STRATTEST Philosophy:**
- Monte Carlo simulation approach
- Statistical sampling methodology
- Virtual market data generation

**AUDIT Philosophy:**
- Event-driven recording approach
- Historical data analysis methodology
- Real market data processing

### 3. Lack of Validation Framework

- No cross-validation between systems
- No reconciliation mechanism
- No error detection or correction

### 4. Time Period Calculation Errors

- Different calendar systems
- Different session definitions
- Different data range interpretations
- Inconsistent timestamp handling

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Implement Cross-Validation**
   - Add reconciliation checks between strattest and audit
   - Flag discrepancies above threshold (e.g., 5%)
   - Generate warning reports for users

2. **Standardize Metric Calculations**
   - Define canonical calculation methods
   - Implement shared calculation libraries
   - Ensure consistent formulas across systems

3. **Fix Time Period Calculations**
   - Standardize calendar definitions
   - Implement consistent session calculations
   - Validate time period consistency

### 2. Medium-Term Solutions (Medium Priority)

1. **Unified Calculation Engine**
   - Merge calculation logic into single engine
   - Use audit system as primary data source
   - Make strattest use audit data for reporting

2. **Enhanced Validation Framework**
   - Implement automated testing for metric consistency
   - Add regression testing for calculation changes
   - Create validation reports for each release

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Document calculation methodologies
   - Explain differences between systems
   - Provide user guidance on interpretation

### 3. Long-Term Architecture (Low Priority)

1. **Single-Source-of-Truth Architecture**
   - Eliminate dual-system approach
   - Implement unified performance calculation
   - Use single audit trail for all reporting

2. **Real-Time Validation**
   - Implement continuous validation during runs
   - Add real-time discrepancy detection
   - Provide immediate feedback on inconsistencies

## Conclusion

The discrepancies between `sentio_cli strattest` and `sentio_audit summarize` results represent a critical architectural issue that undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of the entire system. The dual-system approach has created fundamental inconsistencies in metric calculations, time period definitions, and data interpretation.

**Key Findings:**
- Sharpe ratio discrepancies up to 647%
