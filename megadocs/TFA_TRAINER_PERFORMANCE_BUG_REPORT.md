# TFA Trainer Performance Bug Report

## Executive Summary

The TFA (Transformer Financial Analysis) trainer exhibits significant performance bottlenecks that severely impact training speed and efficiency. Despite recent optimizations, the training process remains unacceptably slow, with multiple critical performance issues identified across the data pipeline, model architecture, and training loop.

## Critical Performance Issues

### 1. Inefficient Data Loading Pipeline
**Severity: HIGH**

The current `SeqWindows` dataset implementation creates significant overhead:

```python
# Current inefficient implementation in sentio_trainer/trainers/tfa.py:47-82
class SeqWindows(torch.utils.data.IterableDataset):
    def __iter__(self):
        B = self.batch
        i = self.start
        T, F = self.T, self.X.shape[1]
        
        # Pre-allocate arrays for better performance
        bx = np.empty((B, T, F), dtype=np.float32)
        by = np.empty((B, 1), dtype=np.float32)
        
        while i <= self.end:
            j = min(self.end + 1, i + B)
            L = j - i
            
            # Vectorized window creation for better performance
            for k, idx in enumerate(range(i, j)):
                lo = idx - T + 1
                bx[k] = self.X[lo:idx+1]  # MEMORY COPY OVERHEAD
                by[k,0] = self.y[idx, 0]
            
            # Yield only the used portion
            yield torch.from_numpy(bx[:L]), torch.from_numpy(by[:L])  # TORCH CONVERSION OVERHEAD
            i = j
```

**Problems:**
- Memory copying overhead for each window creation
- Repeated torch tensor conversions
- No memory mapping or efficient data access patterns
- Sequential processing instead of vectorized operations

### 2. Suboptimal Model Architecture Parameters
**Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Current configuration in `configs/tfa.yaml`:

```yaml
T: 48             # Longer sequence length for better temporal patterns
d_model: 128      # Larger model for more capacity
nhead: 8          # More attention heads
num_layers: 3      # Deeper network
ffn_hidden: 256    # Larger hidden size
batch_size: 1024  # Optimized for better gradient estimates
epochs: 25         # More epochs for better convergence
```

**Problems:**
- Sequence length T=48 is computationally expensive for transformer attention
- Model size (128 d_model, 3 layers) may be overkill for 55-feature input
- Batch size 1024 may be too large for available memory, causing swapping
- 25 epochs may be excessive for convergence

### 3. Inefficient Feature Building
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The C++ feature builder in `include/sentio/feature/feature_from_spec.hpp` processes features sequentially:

```cpp
// Sequential feature processing - lines 68-245
for (int c = 0; c < F; ++c) {
    const auto& f = spec["features"][c];
    const std::string op = f["op"];
    const std::string src = f.value("source", "close");
    
    std::vector<float> col;
    // Process each feature individually...
    
    // Write column to matrix
    for (size_t r = 0; r < N; ++r) {
        M.data[r * F + c] = col[r];  // MEMORY ACCESS PATTERN ISSUE
    }
}
```

**Problems:**
- Column-major memory access pattern is cache-unfriendly
- Sequential processing prevents vectorization opportunities
- No SIMD optimizations for mathematical operations

### 4. Memory Management Issues
**Severity: HIGH**

Multiple memory inefficiencies identified:

```python
# In train_tfa_fast function - lines 336-339
x_path = pathlib.Path(out_dir) / "X.npy"
y_path = pathlib.Path(out_dir) / "y.npy"
np.save(x_path, X.astype(np.float32, copy=False))  # COPY OVERHEAD
np.save(y_path, y.astype(np.float32, copy=False))  # COPY OVERHEAD
```

**Problems:**
- Unnecessary data copying during cache operations
- Large arrays held in memory simultaneously
- No memory pooling or reuse strategies

### 5. Training Loop Inefficiencies
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The training loop in `sentio_trainer/trainers/tfa.py:374-397` has several inefficiencies:

```python
for ep in range(1, epochs+1):
    loss_sum=0.0; steps=0
    batch_count = 0
    
    for bx, by in loader_tr:
        bx, by = bx.to(dev), by.to(dev)  # DEVICE TRANSFER OVERHEAD
        opt.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
        loss = criterion(model(bx), by)
        loss.backward()
        
        # Gradient clipping for stability
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
        
        opt.step()
        # ... progress tracking every 1%
        if batch_count % max(1, total_batches // 100) == 0:
            progress = (batch_count / total_batches) * 100
            print(f"[TFA] Epoch {ep}/{epochs} - {progress:.1f}% - Loss: {loss_sum/steps:.6f}")
```

**Problems:**
- Frequent device transfers (CPU â†” GPU)
- Progress tracking overhead every 1%
- No gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes
- Synchronous operations blocking pipeline
